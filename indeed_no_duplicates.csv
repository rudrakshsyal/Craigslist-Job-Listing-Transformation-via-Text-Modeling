8,Branch Manager,"Play an important role in helping others - and yourself - achieve goals

Edward Jones is a privately owned Fortune 500 Company known for building quality, one-to-one relationships with our clients through more than 14,000 Financial Advisors (FA) across the United States and Canada. Our goal is to build our branch office network to 20,000 FAs and we are searching for talented individuals to help us achieve that vision.

Each FA is supported by a Branch Office Administrator who
Partners with the FA to build deep, trusted client relationships
Enables the FA to focus on providing tailored, solutions-based advice, and
Delivers exceptional client service.
Client service

Edward Jones FAs are known for building quality, one-to-one relationships with their clients - and they're able to maintain those relationships with the help of the BOA. When clients have questions, the FA will often depend on the BOA to provide a timely response.

Client development

An effective marketing communications program is only as strong as the person who implements it on a daily basis. At the FA's direction, the BOA updates prospect and client data records, executes direct mail programs, assists with planning seminars, and makes follow-up phone calls to set or confirm appointments. The BOA also helps the FA deepen existing client relationships by recognizing opportunities during day-to-day client interactions, proactively preparing a variety of reports for scheduled appointments, and scheduling systematic contact activities.

Region and firm assistance

To improve region performance and support our growing firm, we have established a number of regional support programs for all BOAs. While not required, experienced BOAs often volunteer for a program such as mentoring, BOA meeting planning or presentations. They help with an occasional branch visit, workshop or special project.

Certain BOAs will also have the opportunity to play a larger role in their region if their FA holds one of the key leadership positions. This generally involves scheduling meetings, communicating with other branches and compiling reports. Many branches also host a FA trainee for several weeks. In this case, the BOA can be called upon to help the new FAs become familiar with processing systems and office record keeping.

Office administration

This position is ideal for a well-organized person who enjoys multi-tasking and working with both technology and people. Daily office administration duties include assisting the FA in creating and meeting business plans, overseeing appointment setting and schedules, and processing deposits and transactions.

Investing in You

Working at Edward Jones offers many rewards, and our commitment to sharing the firm's success with those who create it makes our total return different from that of other firms. We recognize individual efforts through a competitive reward program and a unique culture that promotes a long-term career, contributes to your financial security, and encourages your and your family's well-being.

Position Requirements
This multi-faceted role is part client service, part client development, and part office management and administration: The branch office administrator (BOA) position requires that you possess the following core competencies:
Exceptional client service abilities
Critical thinking capabilities
Strong initiative, with the ability to stay focused and proactive while working independently

DO YOU LOVE WORKING EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS?
ARE YOU CONTENT WITH MONOTONY?

*THIS MAY NOT BE THE JOB FOR YOU*
Still reading? Good. Were chefs and all of the above runs against the grain of our beliefs. Theres no reason why a chef cant have a sweet job and an actual life at the same time. So, we 86d the old way of thinking and broke the mold while we were at it.
Heres a rundown:
You work the day shift, typically Monday - Friday. You have creative freedom to write your own menus and control your own food purchasing. You get to cook phenomenal food for your customers and really get to know them so you can tailor your menus around what they like to eat. Youve got a massive support system available for when you need some help, be it menu inspiration, a sick sous chef or if you just want some company. Youve got quality of life. Youre home for the important stuff; the ball games, the recitals, the holidays, the date nights - you can truly have a life. You also get several weeks of paid time off surrounding some pretty major holidays. You can finally take that vacation in the winter to somewhere nice and warm and truly get to decompress. Youve also got access to health insurance and a 401k with a competitive salary. Aaand youve got transfer opportunities across the country too if you want.
We cant run a business all wimbly-nimbly though, so get on board with this.

You gotta have a great personality. Seriously, a service minded, friendly and outgoing demeanor is crucial. Insatiable ego-maniac? Forget it.
2: We have a kickass concept of cool food. Approachable, from-scratch, with a cheffy twist. You write the menus, so youre either in or youre out. (We want you in)
3: This is a business. You will have financial responsibilities. Write your menus and order your product within our framework and were good.
You cannot be a work-a-holic. Youve got to like something other than cooking. Fishing, shopping, knitting... The vacation thing is real, so youve got to fill the time with something positive.
Were seriously looking for a talented chef to fill this role in West Lafayette, Indiana. No joke. Experienced chefs only. The job starts in August, but wed prefer to make our offer now...you know, so we can go fishing. Submit your resume for consideration!"

Starting on time is critical to a successful inventory so we are looking for reliable people that can get to the inventories on time and as scheduled.
Safety first! At RGIS it is in our DNA and we are committed to providing associates safe work environments along the way, at every location, and on the way back.
We provide you with an RGIS shirt, as well as guidelines on clothing and proper footwear that youÛªre required to wear. Think of it as showing pride for your favorite team.
Why RGIS?
Opportunities for pay increases after just 5 inventories

We build physics-based, DigitalClone models that predict and improve the lifespan of rotating machine parts from wind turbines to helicopters to rail tracks.

That?s where we come in.
Your Opportunity
We are seeking a highly motivated team member with proven expertise in developing cloud-based, scalable software applications and services that automate new and existing data processes and (small/big data) analytics.

Why Is Sentient A Cut Above
Not very many companies can say their first project was a life and death situation. Sentient Science Corporation started out over ten years ago working on a model to predict when the rotating motors on American Armed Forces helicopters would give out. From there, we took our theories, our processes and our solutions and applied them to wind turbines and clean energy. Whatever our next stop is, we guarantee it will be just as momentous!
Recognized by the White House in 2014 with the Tibbetts Award and Bloomberg New Energy Finance Pioneers Award in 2016, we are far from sitting back and enjoying our success.

Why Is Sentient A Cut Above
Not very many companies can say their first project was a life and death situation. Sentient Science Corporation started out over ten years ago working on a model to predict when the rotating motors on American Armed Forces helicopters would give out. From there, we took our theories, our processes and our solutions and applied them to wind turbines and clean energy. Whatever our next stop is, we guarantee it will be just as momentous!
Recognized by the White House in 2014 with the Tibbetts Award and Bloomberg New Energy Finance Pioneers Award in 2016, we are far from sitting back and enjoying our success. Sentient Science engages more than a dozen Ph.D.Ûªs as part of our well-funded R&D team. To date, one of our greatest accomplishments is being the first company to map the material genome. Our competition is years behind us and we are moving at a pace that suggests they arenÛªt going to catch us any time soon.
Sentient Science is a company that credits our collaborative, innovative and frankly brilliant teams with our success. We are the kind of company where your work makes a difference and serves a purpose bigger than ourselves. Right now, the work we are doing is helping make the world a better place. ItÛªs technology with a purpose. If you want to be part of that, you are passionate and you think you might have the skills to contribute to our progress, send us your qualifications here and we promise to consider them.
